                <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                <pre>
                    [Verse 1]
                    Whispered something in your ear
                    It was a perverted thing to say
                    But I said it anyway
                    Made you smile and look away

                    [Chorus]
                    Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
                    As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
                    Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
                    Nothing's gonna take you from my side

                    [Verse 2]
                    When we dance in my living room
                    To that silly 90's R&B
                    When we have a drink or three
                    Always ends in a hazy shower scene

                    [Chorus]
                    Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
                    As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
                    Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
                    Nothing's gonna take you from my side

                    [Bridge]
                    When we laugh into the microphone and sing
                    With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
                    When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
                    With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs

                    Nothing's gonna take you from my side
