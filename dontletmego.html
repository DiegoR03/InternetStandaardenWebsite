                <h3>Lyrics</h3>
                <pre>
                    [Verse 1]
                    When I was young, I thought the world of you
                    You were all that I wanted then
                    It faded and I never saw you again
                    But I won't forget the love we had

                    [Chorus]
                    Come to me now
                    Don't let me go
                    Stay by my side
                    Don't let me go
                    Stay with me still
                    I've missed you so

                    [Verse 2]
                    When I was young, I thought the world of you
                    I was dumb to let you drift away
                    And though I guess it had to come to an end
                    No one else could have the love we shared

                    [Chorus]
                    Come to me now
                    Don't let me go
                    Stay by my side
                    And my heart goes
                    Out to you
                    Wherever you are

                    [Chorus]
                    Come to me now
                    Don't let me go
                    Stay by my side
                    Don't let me go
                    Stay with me still
                    I've missed you so
